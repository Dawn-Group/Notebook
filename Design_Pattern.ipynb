    "1. Creational Design Patterns;\n",
    " - official definition: Creational design patterns focus on handling object-creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for a given situation. The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project, while these patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process. ---  from book <Learning JavaScript Degsin Patterns>\n",
    " - personla understanding: This method more likely focuse on how your object created, how the class design. Ex. if you want to create a car Object, you probablly think like what features car have, what prproperties car needs. You may have features like driving, may be your car can fly you can have feature like flying. After that, you need prproperties such as Tires since you car need to be drivied. If it can fly, you may need wings. Therefore, you will have a class like\n",
